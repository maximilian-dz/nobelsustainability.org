  text: >-
    World ranked universities, from various countries will select award
    candidates. NST has identifiedsuch institutions in over 40 countries, most
    of which have offered to form committees within their scholastic structures.
    One of these universities will be offered the ACU role and it, in
    consultation with NST, will select and manage the list of universities in
    the NST network. The Sustainability Award Committee will have the final say
    in the selection of the award winners. All persons involved will take
    particular care that the NST Awards are referred to and considered to be,
    independent of the Nobel Prizes.

    The function of a country representative is to act, within the country’s
    jurisdiction, as an ambassador for NST. NST Representatives will seek
    financial support for the creation of its Sustainability Award and funding
    for conference and events management infrastructure associated with the
    award. This will be achieved through, donations and licensing of the NST
    name and services.
  column2: >-
    **Country representatives, professionally managed and in accordance with
    financial regulations, will assist with:**


    * Contacting potential sources such as sovereign funds, corporations, family
    offices and professional associations, to assess whether they would accept
    to sponsor NST’s activities. All interested parties will be subject to a
    strict due diligence and evaluation procedure.

    * Obtaining and maintaining a collaborative agreement with the foremost
    technological universities in the representative’s region or country and to
    ascertain that these academic institutions form and maintain a local
    committee to propose to the lead university or its committee, the invention,
    discovery or technical development which potentially could be of
    demonstrable benefit to the general population in sustainable technology.

    * Assessing the interest in the representative’s home country or its major
    cities in hosting a sustainability conference followed by a Gala Dinner
    including the Award Ceremony.

  heading: The NST Conference on Sustainability
  text: >-
    The annual invitation-only conference will focus on technologies and
    processes, which combat pollution and climate change. Participants will be
    selected from corporations, end users, scientists, legislators and media
    representatives.  The first of conference is planned for summer of 2019.
sectionFive:
  column1: >-
    The local academic institutions will be selected from an internationally
    recognised ranking list by the ACU in consultation with NST. The
    Sustainability Award Committee will consist of members of the various
    faculties it is this committee which will select the suitable candidates for
    the awards on an annual basis. Many universities have created sustainability
    units already, these would be prime

    candidates for membership of the network.


    The members of the committees should meet regularly during a scholastic year
    to identify and evaluate discoveries and developments of sustainable
    technologies. The candidate selections by the local university must be
    submitted to the ACU before the end of each scholastic year.
  column2: >-
    Information about the inventions, discoveries and proposals should be
    collected primarily from the same region as each respective university.
    Improvements on information availability, through social and other media,
    will enable and facilitate collection and transmission of information on new
    developments and technologies, globally.


    NST intends to reimburse local universities a predetermined amount each
    year, for their administrative costs. The amount would be negotiated on a
    case by case basis and agreed annually in advance.


    Each of the university committees will propose a maximum of five candidates
    and the nominations must follow objective and consistent criteria. The
    implementation of the discovery must offer a clear benefit to a majority of
    its potential users, it must be reasonable in development and commercial
    manufacturing costs and offer the possibility to be produced and distributed
    on an unrestricted scale.

    The candidates’ work could be patented or copyrighted at the time of
    submission and could also be in the process of being manufactured on a
    limited scale.

    It is to be expected that most of these institutions already possesses a
    department or centre of sustainability or in any case an informal structure
    devoted to this subject whose members could form the nucleus of such a
    committee. The Award Coordinating University’s Role One of the great
    challenges for the ACU will be the process of managing the number of
    candidates put forward by the university network. Multiple names are likely
    to be submitted.


    It will be the ACU’s job to analyse all the presentations and create a
    short-list of 5 candidates, from which the Awards Selection Committee will
    select the Award winner. IBM’s preliminary selection process will be hugely
    helpful in developing the  short-list but the ACU will be required to
    possess the evaluative capacity and network of experts to ensure its
    competence and ability of selecting appropriate award winners. The aims and
    objectives of NST, as well as anticipating media reaction, must all be taken
    into consideration.


    The Awards Selection Committee will always have final say and a strict
    procees will be observed to ensure that the NST Awards will be recognised as
    being entirely independent of the Nobel Prizes. Location of the Award
    Coordinating University.  The general public and scientific community are
    not generally aware of existing awards and there is no globally recognized
    award in the field of sustainability.


    The foremost academic institutions on the 2018 Times Higher Education
    Ranking, showed that 21 of the top universities  are UK or US based, all of
    these institutions have demonstrated an interest in sustainability. It is
    logical, therefore, that the ACU should also be based in one of these two
    countries. There is a preference, currently for a university in the UK,
    given it proximity to NST and the uncertainty surrounding the United States
    commitment to the Paris Climate Accord. The Award can in this way, retain a
    European flavor.


    The ACU will be allowed to nominate its own candidates. It is, however, the
    principal purpose of the Award Selection Committee, to select the winner and
    the four runners up, from the shortlist which IBM’s artificial intelligence
    program will have compiled from the bulk of the candidates submitted by the
    universities in the network.

    The selected institution responsible for producing the short-list, will
    benefit from substantial academic prestige as the final arbiter of
    sustainable technology development around the world. The project’s
    administrative costs will be relatively modest once it is established so
    long as the project evaluation process is adhered to. NST will, if necessary
    support the ACU financially but it expects all ACU candidates to submit
    proposals, which include a financial model, which sets out estimated costs
    in sufficient detail for NST to ascertain if financial support is required.
  column2: >-
    The annual budget for administration, legal work and salaries for the main
    office in Zürich and the representative offices in Stockholm and Costa Rica
    has been calculated at around €900,000. This amount includes some
    compensation for the Award Selection Committee as well as a contribution to
    some direct administrative costs of the nominating universities.


    Determining a precise budget for the various projects involved in the annual
    award events will depend on the availability of existing facilities and
    resources. Such a project will require substantial funding but the budget
    for each activity will be related to its ambition level. The costs and
    arrangements of a conference in time and complexity will be substantial but
    dependent on the number of participants as well as the budget for the
    following prize events. The total operating budget for all annual activities
    including the Conference and the Award Event has been estimated at
    €2,000,000.
