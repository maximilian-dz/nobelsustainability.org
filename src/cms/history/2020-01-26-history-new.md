    It was formed by the descendants of Immanuel Nobel the younger, i.e. the
    father of Alfred, Ludvig, Robert and Emil Nobel. The first three of the
    aforementioned brothers were engaged from 1873 in establishing, financing
    and operating the BraNobel oil company in Baku, the largest company in
    Russia and the second largest oil company in the world. The Nobel family is
    also represented at the Nobel Prizes Award Ceremonies which are held in
    Stockholm on the 10th of December every year since 1901. In 2007, the Nobel
    family archives, kept in the town archives of Lund, were inscribed in
    UNESCOâ€™s Memory of the World Register.
