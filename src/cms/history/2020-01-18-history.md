    One of his sons, Ludvig Nobel, was the founder of the machine-building
    factory Ludvig Nobel, a great armaments concern and the inventor of the
    Nobel wheel. Ludvig was also the founder of BraNobel, the foremost Russian
    oil industry in it's time, and launched the world's first diesel-driven
    tugs, tankers and u-boats, besides building the first European oil pipeline
    in Baku. Alfred Nobel, a profilic inventor who acquired 355 patents during
    his lifespan, was the creator of dynamite and the blasting cap from which he
    made a substantial future of which he left the bulk to form the Nobel
    Prizes.

    It was formed by the descendants of Immanuel Nobel the younger, i.e. the
    father of Alfred, Ludvig, Robert and Emil Nobel. The first three of the
    aforementioned brothers were engaged from 1873 in establishing, financing
    and operating the BraNobel oil company in Baku, the largest company in
    Russia and the second largest oil company in the world. The Nobel family is
    also represented at the Nobel Prizes Award Ceremonies which are held in
    Stockholm on the 10th of December every year since 1901. In 2007, the Nobel
    family archives, kept in the town archives of Lund, were inscribed in
    UNESCOâ€™s Memory of the World Register.
