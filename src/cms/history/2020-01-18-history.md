    and operating the BraNobel oil company in Baku, the largest company in
    Russia and the second largest oil company in the world. The Nobel family is
    also represented at the Nobel Prizes Award Ceremonies which are held in
    Stockholm on the 10th of December every year since 1901. In 2007, the Nobel
    family archives, kept in the town archives of Lund, were inscribed in
